# Start ADR

[Architecture Decision Records](https://www.fabian-keller.de/blog/documenting-architecture-decisions/) helps clarify, log and understand later why an important decision was taken.

It helps your future self know **why** this was made this way, even if it's just because you wanted some fun or you did not know what you were doing ^^

The most important is to write them regularly when some decisions are taken so they can be very concise but here are an interesting list of topic to cover:
- what is the problem the decision is trying to solve
- what is the decision
- why this solution was chosen (pros, cons, trade offs, warnings...)
- what were the alternatives
