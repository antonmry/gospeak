# Project conventions

List here conventions for the project as a reference for everyone.

They are expected to be followed but not strictly enforced.

## Git

Branch naming:
- `feat/123/the-feature-name` for a feature from the issue #123
- `fix/123/fix-description` for a fix described in the issue #123
- `mob/123/the-feature-name` for a feature done in a mob programming session

If feature or fix is not from a github issue, you can skip the issue number section
